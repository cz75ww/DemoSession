# Demo session to deploy new webserver (Nginx)
## Requirements
* Terraform v1 or latest
* Ansible 2.9  or latest

## Introduction
* This automation is to the creation and deployment of a web server on AWS environment with health checks to as the server is up and running.
* Here we are using terraform with Ansible (IaC tool) to build resources/services needs in order to deploy the server


## Why do we need both Terraform and Ansible?
* Terraform is designed to provision different infrastructure components
* Ansible is a configuration-management and application-deployment tool. 
* It means that youâ€™ll use Terraform first to create, for example, a virtual machine and then use Ansible to install necessary applications on that machine. But by default, these two are separate tools. In order to make them work together, we need to integrate Terraform-managed nodes with Ansible control nodes.
