# Demo session to deploy new webserver (Nginx)
## Requirements
* Terraform v1 or latest
* Ansible 2.9  or latest

## Introduction
* This automation is to the creation and deployment of a web server on AWS environment with health checks to as the server is up and running.
* Here we are using IaC tools, Terraform and Ansible to achieve our target.


## Why do we need both Terraform and Ansible?
* Terraform is designed to provision different infrastructure components.
* Ansible is a configuration-management and application-deployment tool. 
* It means that youâ€™ll use Terraform first to create, for example, AWS resources (vpc, subnet and virtual machine) and then use Ansible to install necessary applications on that machine. But by default, these two are separate tools. In order to make them work together, we need to integrate Terraform-managed nodes with Ansible control nodes.
* [TerraformAnsible](https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/ansible-terraform-better-together) - Good page and video explaining why Ansible and HashiCorp are  better together.


## Terraform
#### To deploy the AWS resources,terraform will create the following resources:
* VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
* Public Subnet
* Internet Gatway
* Route Table
* Public Security Group (Firewall rules for ssh,icmp, https and http protocols)
* Run Ansible playbook tasks
### As a good practice, keep your terraform.tfstate file in a backend - [TerraformBackend](https://www.terraform.io/language/settings/backends)

## Ansible
#### To install the applications, packages and apply the following settings:
*  Set up the hostname
*  Apply OS patches
*  Install requirements packages
*  Create web page directory
*  Delete default nginx site
*  Apply custom nginx
*  Check virtual machine public ip
*  Verify if the webpage has been started successfully

## Setup
#### To run this project, perform the command lines:
* In the terrform root folder change the webserver01.tf according your needs.
* in the ansible roles vars folder, change the server name into main.yaml.
./terraform/modules/acceptance-ubuntu-vm/ansible/roles/custom_tasks/vars/main.yaml
```
$ git clone https://github.com/cz75ww/DemoSession.git
$ Terraform init
$ terraform apply --auto-approve
```
## Web health check script
#### The goal of this script is to check the health of webpage <br/>
     script name: web_health_check.sh
##### Requirements:
* Create AWS SNS topic in order to send the email with the notification. - [CreateSNSTopic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-create-topic.html)
* AWS Cli installed on job server that will be run the script. For example, linux cron job
* AWS profile configured
